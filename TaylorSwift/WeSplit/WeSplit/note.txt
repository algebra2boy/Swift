@State var <the name of the variable> = <start value>
    -> modifying values in a swiftUI view
@State private var tapCount = 0
    -> make sure this is not accessed elsewhere, other than the local
    
TextField {}
    - make a container that accepts and write value from

 A two-way binding: we bind the text field so that it shows the value of our property, but we also bind it so that any changes to the text field also update the property.
    - it means it can read from the value and also write the value back to the variable
    - we would use the special sign, $

Using a ForEach loop
Form {
    ForEach(0..<10) { number in
        Text("Row \(number)")
    }
}

shorthand closure
Form {
    ForEach(0..<10) {
        Text("Row \($0)")
    }
}


Picker {}
    - A control for selecting from a set of mutually exclusive events 

NavigationView {
            Form {
                Picker("Select your friend",
                        // this is the placeholder
                       selection: $selectedStudent) {
                    // looping over the array, id:\.self is important to let swift to identify the element, which is the student
                    ForEach(students, id:\.self) {
                        Text($0)
                    }
                }
            }
