# Notes

- @Published publishes change announcements automatically.
- @StateObject watches for those announcements and refreshes any views using the object.
- sheet() watches a condition we specify and shows or hides a view automatically.
- Codable can convert Swift objects into JSON and back with almost no code from us.
- UserDefaults can read and write data so that we can save settings and more instantly.
